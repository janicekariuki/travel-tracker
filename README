✈️ Travel Tracker
The Travel Tracker is a simple web app where users can:

Save their travel destinations.

Add an image and a travel date for each trip.

See a list of all trips saved.

Remove trips if needed.

Data is saved in localStorage, so trips stay even after refreshing!

🧹 Validate to make sure all fields are filled (alerts if missing).

📸 Display each trip with image, name, and date.

🗑️ Remove trips individually.

💾 Local storage support — trips stay saved even after browser refresh.

🛠️ Technologies Used

JavaScript (ES6) — vanilla (no libraries)

🚀 How to Use
Open the website.

Fill out the destination name, image URL, and travel date.

Click "Add Destination" to save it.
